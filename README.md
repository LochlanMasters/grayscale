WordPress port of grayscale bootstrap theme (https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)

I really like this theme but wanted to run it on WP, I somehow hacked it onto WP in November of 2015 and when I revisited it later I dont even understand what I did to make it work in the first place as it was running under WP but wasnt a theme? again no idea what I did. But heading into the new year I am moving my hosting to AWS and needed to do some clean up. This is now an installable WP theme of grayscale, updated to use the latest Bootstrap 3.3.7 and the latest from the grayscale github repository.

A few notes about my changes is other than the grayscale css/js I have chose to pull the other libraries from cdn as I had issues with the mapping in the WP theme and the map feature does not seem to work completely. Additionally this only functions as a single page app and has to be manually edited before install as WP is really not my area of expertise and I dont have time to figure out how to make the sections editable or to change it to multipage.

Special note on multipage: If you try to add a page through wordpress it will allow you and I think I resolved the css/js loading issue for multiple pages but no content is ever rendered.

If any one has thoughts or improvements ideas please let me know as I do really like this theme and would like it to be more flexible than it is.

I hope it helps someone, enjoy :)
